## Article 1: Scope
1. Assinging Scope
	1. A member is to be granted scope that matches their ability to manage targets in said scope. 

	2. Scope is calculated by a senior member on the basis of the members individual power and ability to move between/remotely manage targets of a given scope.

	3. Scope may be refused by a member upon assignment, however once accepted, the member is compelled to oversee that scope till the end.
	

2. Removing Scope

		1. They fail to request a scope extension
		2. They request a termination of scope
		3. An infraction is observed
		4. The member is unable to meet the requirements of their scope (See Article 1: 2ii for details)

	2. If a member is unable to meet the requirements for their scope due to injury or a sudden drop in power
	then the member is permitted to either immeidately drop their contract or be given half the full duration of their 
	contract for recovery, wherein they may request another member of the same league to oversee this leave. If they recover
	they may recieve an automatic extension of their scope equal to the days they were taking leave. Failure to recover
	in the allocated time will result in the contract being surrendered to the members replacement.
	
	3. In the event of a surrendered contract one of the following may happen

		1. A member of equivalent power level is to be assigned to the scope. If one is not found in a timely manner, one of lower or
		greater power may be assigned, granted that the opposing league matches the given disparity. If neither party is 
		able to reach an agreement on a new assignment, then the disputed scope will be overseen by the Way of Balance until one is
		found.

		2. If a member is granted a surrendered contract but its duration is less than minimum payable amount to a members account, then the difference is garnished
		from the previous scope holders wages. In the event that the new contract holder wishes waive these funds, then the previous contract holders wages are not
		garnished
