The two leagues are organizations that both lean toward the "lawful" side of the good and evil spectrum.
They're both commited to keeping the balance between good and evil in check no matter what the cost and as a result
both sides follow a very strict set of rules around when/how someone can do acts of  good or evil. The core concept being that
both organizations have a method of arbitration to prevent evil lich's from taking over the world and stopping crusaders
from crushing all evil, as has happened several times in the past. Working for these organizations offers a great deal of benefits 
for most do gooders/evilers, such as access to steady work, allies and resources, however participating as a member does mean that
one needs to strictly follow the rules outlined in the articles of neutrality, otherwise they risk garnished rewards, explusion or 
corporeal punishment. 

For the most part the public is unknowing of these entities and simply considers them "the good guys" and "the bad guys". Even low 
level members of these organizations have little knowledge of the overarching details of the organization and rarely obey protocol to a t.
